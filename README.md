# This is my README

Not entirely sure how to start this, but I use baraction.sh (in bin/), called from .spectrwm.conf, to execute conky and pipe to dzen2. You can find the .conkyrc here as well. I suppose that's it for now?

#### SSH keys
Welp, if you haven't used ssh keys for anything else, use them to push changes to git repo. Work in conjunction with keychain (from the gentoo brethren) for added sexy!
