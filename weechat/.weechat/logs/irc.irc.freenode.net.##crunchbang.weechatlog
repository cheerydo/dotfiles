2014-05-22 23:48:46	torna1nbow	nice window/buffer management.
2014-05-22 23:49:08	torna1nbow	extra fancy scripts. it feels a lot saner than irssi i think
2014-05-22 23:49:10	torna1nbow	me likey
2014-05-22 23:49:44	Darryl	Does anyone know of a good tiling window manager? not i3. If it is a manual tiling Window manager I have no probem :)
2014-05-22 23:49:47	xskoulax	yep wee feels nice, though i haven't meessed with scripts or anything
2014-05-22 23:50:18	Darryl	xskoulax: You are using herbstluftwm?
2014-05-22 23:50:20	torna1nbow	xskoulax: yeah grep.py to search through logs and scrollback is fantastic. binding keys is much saner. and i like the iset script that configs
2014-05-22 23:50:32	torna1nbow	Darryl: i really love spectrwm
2014-05-22 23:50:40	torna1nbow	as far as tiling wms go

2014-05-22 23:51:06	xskoulax	i3 Darryl
2014-05-22 23:51:14	Darryl	:)
2014-05-22 23:51:22	torna1nbow	and, one of the biggest things about irssi, having to fifo a nicklist. weechat comes with it OOTB!
2014-05-22 23:51:29	torna1nbow	i could get used to this
2014-05-22 23:51:51	torna1nbow	mouse support, mmhmmm

2014-05-22 23:55:20	 *	xskoulax takes a minute to remember the thunder
2014-05-22 23:55:43	torna1nbow	haha. i don't think i'll be ordering your products
2014-05-22 23:57:08	xskoulax	<sales voice> If you order now we'll throw in a free tmux. If you decide that weechat is not for you just return it withing 30 days for a full refund, and keep the tmux just for trying weechat
2014-05-22 23:57:22	Varrash	anyone up for some cards against humanity? http://cah.gaben.xxx jump in and join our game guise

2014-05-22 23:57:36	xskoulax	the first spin of that was superior but irc ruined it
2014-05-22 23:58:27	Darryl	thetornainbow: Does spectrwm tile in  the same fasion?
2014-05-22 23:58:36	torna1nbow	same fashion as what?
2014-05-22 23:58:42	xskoulax	</sales voice>, if you order now you'll get a free tmux, and if you dislike the weechat for any reason just return it within 30 days for a full refund and keep the tmux as our gift to you for trying weechat.
2014-05-22 23:58:57	 *	xskoulax is an idiot for not remembering he can recall a line
2014-05-22 23:59:20	torna1nbow	but i've already got a tmux!
2014-05-22 23:59:31	xskoulax	well give tmux to a friend
2014-05-22 23:59:31	Darryl	thetornainbow: I mean does it tile in the same order or does it have many other mays to tile. I mean one big window on the left and small window in the right :)
2014-05-22 23:59:50	xskoulax	not like we can have an unlimited supply of different free treats
2014-05-23 00:00:28	xskoulax	ohhh wait a minute i have a cookie jar, i'll make an exception in you case and throw in the cookie jar. but don't forget to share

2014-05-23 00:04:02	torna1nbow	well actually, if you've ever used dwm or xmonad, it's tiling scheme is the exact same. primary window tiles to 50% of the screen, while all other windows opened on a desktop tile in the secondary 50% portion. although that 50/50 ratio can be changed with MOD+h/l
2014-05-23 00:08:26	torna1nbow	the 50/50 split can be horizontal/vertical. 
2014-05-23 00:08:27	ParkerR	"onetwo_> I am a total scrub, so no." senpai! say it aint so
2014-05-23 00:08:32	torna1nbow	or fullscreen mode of course
2014-05-23 00:09:49	torna1nbow	and the config file is plain text, like i3, which is a huge plus for me
2014-05-23 00:13:08	torna1nbow	you guys really should get in on this cards against humanity game
