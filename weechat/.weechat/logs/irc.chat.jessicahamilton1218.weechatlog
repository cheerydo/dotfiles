2014-05-27 09:34:06	jared	when?
2014-05-27 09:34:10	jessicahamilton1218	this weekend
2014-05-27 09:34:14	jessicahamilton1218	i forgot to ask
2014-05-27 09:34:36	jessicahamilton1218	am i wrong?
2014-05-27 09:35:03	jared	i already have started my own repo :). it's how i keep things synced up between my laptop and desktop, and how i track changes in case i/arch breaks something. plus it gives me a good chance to practice version control
2014-05-27 09:35:25	jessicahamilton1218	haha
2014-05-27 09:35:30	jessicahamilton1218	version control?
2014-05-27 09:36:58	jared	yeah. meaning across a project or whatever, version controlling allows you to commit snapshots of your work however often you'd like and then publish those snapshots to a server that hosts git repos (like github or bitbucket) so you can track changes of a project, collaboratively work on the same project with other people, or fork an existing project.
2014-05-27 09:38:50	jared	it's really cool actually. say you were working on a website, which you kept in a directory on your computer called ABCWebsite or something. you could see exactly what changes you made since you started the project, step backwards in time to any point in case you didn't like the work you had done on it for the past few weeks, and if i wanted to contribute to it, i would just issue the
2014-05-27 09:38:50	jared	command "git clone http://www.whateverwebsiteyouhostedon.com/ABCWebsite.git"
2014-05-27 09:39:45	jared	and then i would have the exact folder with all of the files you had been working on on my computer, and i could change something and then "push" my changes to the server, which you could then add to your folder on your computer. 
2014-05-27 09:40:10	jared	it's a great way to share a project, or really anything, that changes over time and across multiple locations.
2014-05-27 09:40:14	jared	and it's used all the time
2014-05-27 09:40:37	jared	so managing my own repo will give me a good chance to learn the ins and outs :)
2014-05-27 09:41:30	jessicahamilton1218	nice :)
2014-05-27 09:42:28	jared	yeah. it's also the way most applications are shared on linux. like the terminal i really like using? it's this guy's github repo that he hosts, to install you download his source code, compile and install
2014-05-27 09:42:32	jared	which is pretty awesome
2014-05-27 09:43:56	jared	plus, any time he makes a change, or adds some feature or whatever, i get it immediately. the web browser i use? dwb? same thing. a few weeks ago, i got in the IRC room that the dwb creator hangs out in, asked him about an issue i was having, he said he had fixed it in the latest "snapshot", and gave me a link to download the patched code and recompile, and the issue was fixed in a few
2014-05-27 09:43:56	jared	minutes. 
2014-05-27 09:49:32	jessicahamilton1218	wow
2014-05-27 09:49:40	jessicahamilton1218	so it automatically updates from github
2014-05-27 09:49:41	jessicahamilton1218	?
2014-05-27 09:50:09	jared	well, with a command, yes

2014-08-05 09:50:35	jessicahamilton1218	i started the day off with codecademy again
2014-08-05 09:51:08	jessicahamilton1218	just 2 more lessons and then I'll be past the stuff I know :D
2014-08-05 09:51:26	jessicahamilton1218	and on the beginner CSS!
2014-08-05 10:00:36	jared	nice! i'm excited. you could build a custom CSS for me!
2014-08-05 10:12:27	jared	i can't wait till you get home. i have stumbled on the coolest thing ever
2014-08-05 10:12:40	jared	i've been playing with it for the past hour
2014-08-05 10:12:46	jessicahamilton1218	haha is it a game?
2014-08-05 10:14:30	jared	no it's a program that precisely controls the system beep a computer emits directly from the sound card
2014-08-05 10:14:53	jared	you know that like machine-ey "ping" when your computer is booting up and stuff like that?
2014-08-05 10:15:20	jessicahamilton1218	yeah?
2014-08-05 10:16:20	jared	anyway this program lets you control that sound down the length of time a tone plays and the MHz of that signal. i've found a couple of guys in this irc channel that compete to do the most complicated songs. i just listened to one of bach's etudes played by my computer hardware. and now i'm working on my own :)
2014-08-05 10:17:04	jessicahamilton1218	omg
2014-08-05 10:18:56	jared	i wish i could share it with you. but you're on windows. :(
