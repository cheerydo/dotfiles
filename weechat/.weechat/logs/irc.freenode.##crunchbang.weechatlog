2014-05-27 11:00:43	thetornainbow	it's much easier to set up static ips from your router, not netctl
2014-05-27 11:01:14	boboysdadda	Darryl: my /etc/resolv.conf is google dns
2014-05-27 11:01:24	boboysdadda	my router is a belkin
2014-05-27 11:01:26	boboysdadda	its stupid
2014-05-27 11:01:29	Darryl	netctl has an example folder /etc/netctl/example/ that contains various config.

2014-05-27 11:01:47	Darryl	:O :D
2014-05-27 11:01:47	boboysdadda	ended up using systemd

2014-05-27 11:02:18	boboysdadda	but it took 15 minutes of me in #archlinux of this dude just saying don't use netctl
2014-05-27 11:02:23	thetornainbow	yeah if your router is trying to dynamically assign an ip address every time your dhcp lease expires, but you've configured a static ip on your box, you're gonna have a bad time
2014-05-27 11:02:33	boboysdadda	fucker wouldn't just say wiki static IP with systemd
2014-05-27 11:02:38	thetornainbow	boboysdadda: yeah they are like that a lot
2014-05-27 11:03:05	thetornainbow	it get s old
2014-05-27 11:03:07	boboysdadda	thetornainbow: my router is to stupid. i don't have that problem
2014-05-27 11:03:19	boboysdadda	i can static from my machine just fine and the router just shuts up and takes it like a bitch
2014-05-27 11:03:33	thetornainbow	that's beautiful imagery
