2014-05-27 11:47:22	tornainbow	hey what's up everybody. is there a way to get more verbose output from errors?
2014-05-27 11:47:58	tornainbow	i'm trying to get weechat set up on a server of mine, but for some reason the connection to irc.freenode.net is being refused, but i need a little more info to go on
2014-05-27 11:49:08	gb	what error do you get presently?
2014-05-27 11:49:39	gb	and how are you trying to connect to freenode?
2014-05-27 11:50:13	gb	there are many different reasons a connection might fail but usually it is due to you having set something incorrectly
2014-05-27 11:50:49	gb	so tell us what you did to arrive in this mess :)
2014-05-27 11:51:25	tornainbow	well, i connect with "/connect chat.freenode.net/6667" as usual
2014-05-27 11:52:00	gb	did you set a nick?
2014-05-27 11:52:16	gb	i often got the could not connect because no nick was set error

2014-05-27 11:52:52	tornainbow	and it just gives irc: connecting to server chat.freenode.net/6667 (IPv6)...
2014-05-27 11:52:59	tornainbow	irc: connection refused
2014-05-27 11:53:03	tornainbow	then it tries reconn
2014-05-27 11:53:09	Kays	try with ipv4. Maybe you don't have ipv6 set up properly
2014-05-27 11:53:18	Kays	/connect -ipv4 chat.freenode.net/6667
2014-05-27 11:53:24	gb	ahh that is why that lil bit after (IPv6)
2014-05-27 11:53:24	grawity	if it says "connection _refused_", it quite sounds like a firewall is blocking it
2014-05-27 11:53:48	grawity	IPv6 misconfiguration, on the other hand, usually results in long delays or "No route to host"
2014-05-27 11:54:04	Kays	grawity: hmm from the host or freenode?
2014-05-27 11:54:14	gb	i do know if you wish to use ip6 there are dedicated ipv6 freenode servers
2014-05-27 11:54:23	grawity	Kays: where â€“ the firewall?
2014-05-27 11:54:34	grawity	Kays: could be anywhere between, really.
2014-05-27 11:54:44	gb	are you intending to connect via ipv6?
2014-05-27 11:54:45	tornainbow	that's what i thought too, but forcing the ipv4 switch gives exact same error
2014-05-27 11:54:49	tornainbow	gb: nope
2014-05-27 11:55:47	gb	what version?

2014-05-27 11:57:49	gb	it could possibly be a bug that has been fixed
2014-05-27 11:58:18	Kays	if you're going to build it, may as well go for 1.0-de
